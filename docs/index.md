# Document Iteration Skill

Welcome to the documentation for the Document Iteration Skill - a structured markdown syntax for iterating on documents with Claude AI.

## Quick Links

- [SKILL](skill.md) - The complete skill file
- [Examples](examples.md) - See the syntax in action
- [FAQ](faq.md) - Common questions answered
- [Contributing](contributing.md) - How to contribute
- [workflow-examples/obsidian workflow/Obsidian Workflow](obsidian-workflow.md) - How this documentation system works

## What is this?

This skill teaches Claude a feedback syntax so you can:

- Add `%% comments %%` directly in documents
- Mark specific text with `==highlights==(TOKEN)`
- Get Claude's responses inline with `%% > answers %%`
- Track everything in git

## Getting Started

1. Add `SKILL.md` to your Claude project
2. Create a markdown document
3. Add feedback using the syntax
4. Ask Claude to update it

That's it! Claude will read your feedback and respond inline.
