# Claude App Repo Review - Summary

**Date:** December 14, 2024
**Reviewed:** v2.3 (now v3.0)

---

## Implemented

- [x] Version sync rule in `.claude.md`
- [x] 30-second quick start in README
- [x] Comparison table in README
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created
- [x] Troubleshooting added to FAQ (Claude being eager, chat-style responses)
- [x] YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md (already existed)

## Future Work (Placeholders Created)

- [ ] Real-world sanitized examples (`_real-world-examples.md`)
- [ ] VS Code snippets (`_vscode-snippets.md`)
- [ ] Visual demo/GIF

## Key Insights

1. **Version sync is critical** - Added mandatory rule to `.claude.md`
2. **Troubleshooting matters** - Users need to know how to handle Claude's eager behavior
3. **Lower barrier to entry** - 30-second quick start with download link helps adoption

## Not Applicable

- `collaborative-workflow-project-summary.md` mentioned in review doesn't exist (hallucination or old cache)
- No orphaned files found in repo structure
