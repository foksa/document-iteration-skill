# Real-World Examples (TODO)

Future addition: Sanitized real-world iteration examples.

## Planned Content

### 1. Messy → Clean Transformation
Show a document going through multiple iteration rounds:
- Initial draft with issues
- User feedback with tokens
- Claude responses
- Final cleaned version

### 2. Edge Cases Discovered
Document tricky scenarios encountered during actual use:
- Complex nested tokens
- Multi-paragraph comments
- Handling conflicting feedback

### 3. Before/After Comparisons
Side-by-side showing:
- Original document
- Iteration markers added
- Final result after cleanup

## Source Material
- Documentation for this skill was built using the skill itself
- Can sanitize and extract examples from that process

## Status
Not started - placeholder for future work.
