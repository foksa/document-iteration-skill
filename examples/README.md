# Examples

Real-world examples of document iteration using this skill.

## Structure

Each example is a subfolder containing:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `iteration.md` | The working document with full iteration history (`%% comments %%` and `•%%> responses <%%•`) |
| `result.md` | The final output after iteration (cleaned or ready-to-use) |

## Available Examples

### [project-setup-prompt](project-setup-prompt/)

Creating a project setup prompt through iterative refinement.

- **Goal**: Design a reusable prompt for setting up new software projects with documentation workflows
- **Iterations**: ~30+ back-and-forth exchanges
- **Topics covered**: folder structure, git setup, editor configs, build scripts, GitHub Pages
- **Result**: A complete 10-step project setup prompt

## Adding Examples

To add a new example:

1. Create a subfolder with a descriptive name (e.g., `api-design/`, `feature-spec/`)
2. Add `iteration.md` - the working document with all markup intact
3. Add `result.md` - the final polished output
4. Update this README with a description

Examples should showcase:
- How iteration markup enables structured feedback
- The progression from rough idea to polished output
- Real decisions and trade-offs discussed during iteration
