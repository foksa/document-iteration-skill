## What is this?

This skill teaches Claude a feedback syntax so you can:

- Add `%% comments %%` directly in documents
- Mark specific text with `==highlights==(TOKEN)`
- Get Claude's responses inline with `%% > answers %%`
- Track everything in git

## Getting Started

1. Add `SKILL.md` to your Claude project
2. Create a markdown document
3. Add feedback using the syntax
4. Ask Claude to update it

That's it! Claude will read your feedback and respond inline.
